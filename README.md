# Clustering-with-Expectation-Maximization-and-Affinity-Probagation-from-Scratch
This code implements Expectation Maximization and Affinity Probagation Cluserting algorithms from Scratch. The code was tested to cluser the images of MINST dataset to compare it to the result of regular supervised classification algorithms. The results can be seen in the PDF report attached. This code was a part of the ML course at AUC.
